# GMtest
Website build from psd using jQuery, Bootstrap, and Slick Slider. Styled the HTML form. Used Avocode for design specs. Made an executive design decision to abort the overlay of the feature cards due to resizing issues. Favicons need to be loaded and styled- using static image for now. Mobile and tablet responsiveness are the final element, though I normally start with mobile and build desktop last.
